# vtodos

Work in progress...
This is being made for educational purposes only

This is what i'm trying to learn with this project:
```
-Slim framework
-PDO
-more PHP
-RESTful APIs
-more SQL
-Some more vue
-probably more stuff as this goes on
```

I'm trying my best to make this as well structured as possible, so bear with me ;)
